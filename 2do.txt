                - Give a user friendly response when the badge is used;
                - Terminate the authentication
   -> what need to be done (marc):  



*** 2DO - Front end :



** Implement the constraints .. check list/specs by Anthony F. ... check papernotes ?! ...
  [FE : OK]  1.    White list of users: no logon, no access
  [BE : ??]  2.    Permitted user groups:
                    a.    ‘T’ = Tester: must only see/use devices for his group
                    b.    ‘I’ = Incubator: must see/use devices for his group + ‘T’
                    c.    ‘S’ = Savi: must see/use devices for his group + ‘T’
                    d.    ‘B’ = Business: must only see/use devices for his group
                    e.    ‘A’ = admin: must see everything 

  [FE : OK]  3.    Max. number of devices per user = 3
  [FE : ][BE : ]  4.  Max. duration LOCKED per device: 15min .. 
                      >> action  : unlock device automatically (by BE ?)

  [FE: OK] list of users only available for administrator
  

** 
  -- QUID ErrorMessages (= HTTP 200 ?!) returned by BackEnd ??
  -- CRUD operations 4 administrators .. on Devices, on Users, ...

  -- List (devices && users) columns must be aligned
  -- List Devices .. devices inuse && locked should be aligned vertically with list #3


*** 2DO - Back end :

-- provide a service operation which returns configuration items : max nbr of devices per user, ..

-- return the device list in function of the user (profile ..)
-- only the valid user can be authenticated
-- for an admin, also the unavailable device are returned, not for the other
-- list of user only available for administrator
-- how to communicate between the badge and the user







** Questions / 2check :

° Quid a BUILD app approach based on Grunt/Gulp or Webpack ?!

°°° quid the actions (lock, unlock, confirm & return) buttons for administrators ?? ... can an administrator also play the role of a tester, of a .. ??
