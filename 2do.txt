                - Terminate the authentication
   -> what need to be done (marc):

  ** define the API contracts for creating a new and/or updating an existing user :

  -- QUID ErrorMessages (= HTTP 200 ?!) returned by BackEnd ?? .. check refactored ErrorMessages returned by BE = Slack message by Marwan

  -- CRUD operations 4 administrators .. on Devices, on Users, ...

  -- List (devices && users) columns must be aligned
  -- List Devices .. devices inuse && locked should be aligned vertically with list #3


*** 2DO - Back end :

<<<<<<< HEAD
-- provide a service operation which returns configuration items : max nbr of devices per user, ..

-- return the device list in function of the user (profile ..)
-- only the valid user can be authenticated
-- for an admin, also the unavailable device are returned, not for the other users/profiles
-- list of user only available for administrator

>>>>>>> 7c486883c2055bbd9305403787664274a3f53be9
-- how to communicate between the badge and the user



** Nice to have :

-- FE : add new user : property 'enddate' should be greater than today
-- FE : main menu-option Users is only enabled for Users with profile == administrator
-- FE : delegate the toastr calls into a seperate nodification 'class' : service, facory or provider ?




** Questions / 2check :

° Quid a BUILD app approach based on Grunt/Gulp or Webpack ?!

°°° quid the actions (lock, unlock, confirm & return) buttons for administrators ?? ... can an administrator also play the role of a tester, of a .. ??
