*** TODO ASAP :

-- organise demo for end user
   -> what need to be done (marwan): 
                - Give a user friendly response when the badge is used;
                - Terminate the authentication
   -> what need to be done (marc):  


Front end:

*** Quid the action (lock, unlock, confirm & return) buttons for administrators ??

** Implement the constraints .. check list/specs by Anthony F. ... check papernotes ?! ...
  []  1.    White list of users: no logon, no access
  []  2.    Permitted user groups:
        a.    ‘T’ = Tester: must only see/use devices for his group
        b.    ‘I’ = Incubator: must see/use devices for his group + ‘T’
        c.    ‘S’ = Savi: must see/use devices for his group + ‘T’
        d.    ‘B’ = Business: must only see/use devices for his group
        e.    ‘A’ = admin: must see everything J
  []  3.    Max. number of devices per user = 3
  []  4.    Max. duration per device:
        a.    B: 48 hrs
        b.    T/I/S: either 5 hrs, or EOB
                                                        

  [OK] list of user only available for administrator
  

-- QUID ErrorMessages (= HTTP 200 ?!) returned by BackEnd ??
-- CRUD operations 4 administrators .. on Devices, on Users, ...

-- Disable menu-option(s) in case of unauthorized access, e.g. only admins can see the list of users 
-- List (devices && users) columns must be aligned
-- List Devices .. devices inuse && locked should be aligned vertically with list #3


Back end:
-- return the device list in function of the user
-- only the valid user can be authenticated
-- for an admin, also the unavailable device are returned, not for the other
-- list of user only available for administrator
-- how to communicate between the badge and the user


After Care:
-- 

Documentation:

-- complete / update the My SQL database 'create' script ?


** Questions :

° Quid a BUILD app approach based on Grunt/Gulp or Webpack ?!
