*** TODO ASAP :

-- organise demo for end user
   -> what need to be done (marwan): 
                - Give a user friendly respone when the badge is used;
                - Terminate the authentication
   -> what need to be done (marc):  

Front end:
-- Implement the constraints .. check list/specs by Anthony F. ...
-- List Devices .. devices inuse && locked should be aligned vertically with list #3
-- CRUD operations 4 administrators .. on Devices, on Users, ...
-- list of user only available for administrator
-- the user can lock and use only 5 devices
-- the column must be aligned

Back end:
-- return the device list in function of the user
-- only the valid user can be authenticated
-- for an admin, also the unavailable device are returned, not for the other
-- list of user only available for administrator
-- how to communicate between the badge and the user
